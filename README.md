# Subtitle Dictionary

Work in progress! 

Use this to open dictionary that will tell definition of words in real time and in that context using AI. As of now configured to use gemini-flash-2.5-lite and for two languages only:

1) Arabic
2) Spanish

You can easily modify to add more languages! Just open html in visual studio code and ask copilot to add support for any other language to language. 

For example French -> German dictionary, if you're German trying to learn french! 

You will need google AI studio API Key that you can get for free at https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys and enter it in the required field!

Few screenshots!
